Edit only MainWindow.xaml and MaionWindow.xaml.cs if you are new to this
and if you don't know what the other files are doing. Or at least this is
recommended to do so it won't mess up the files.

You can find the GUI (Graphical User Interface) configurations in 
MainWindow.xaml and you can modify it the way you want it to be.

You can find the Program file that's running behind the scenes while you 
see the GUI, and the configuration file for that is the MainWindow.xaml.cs.

If you use VS Code and Terminal / Command Prompt to run your application, then use 
'dotnet run', it will run your whole program!
