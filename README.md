# Project_Automatization
A python script is making the project folders and virtual environments and all the things that you need for your project in a specific programming language! It also sets up all the needed files so you don't have to worry about them. 

## Need to do / have things
For this to work properly, you will need VS Code, Python3 (Any python3 will do as far as I know) and basically that's it, if you have any problem with it, please warn me about that, so I can fix that and expand this so it won't have problems later!

## Plans
The script is mainly optimized for just Linux yet, It was not tested on Windows yet, might be a Windows version in the future.

Later on, hopefully the script will get a more usable version by simplifying everything for the user.
