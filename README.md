# Project_Automatization
This little python script is making the project folders and virtual environments and all the things that you need for your project in a specific programming language! 

# Plans
The script is mainly optimized for just Linux yet, It was not tested on Windows yet, might be a Windows version in the future.

Later on, hopefully the script will get a more usable version by simplifying everything for the user.
